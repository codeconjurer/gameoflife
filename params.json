  "body": "### GOL (Game of life ).\r\ngameoflife provides an example of emergence and self-organization. Scholars in various fields, such as computer science, physics, biology, biochemistry, economics, mathematics, philosophy, and generative sciences have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules[citation needed]. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that \"design\" and \"organization\" can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett has used the analogue of Conway's Life \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.\r\n### Rules\r\nThe universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or \"populated\" or \"unpopulated\" (the difference may seem minor, except when viewing it as an early model of human/urban behavior simulation or how one views a blank space on a grid). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\r\n\r\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.\r\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\r\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.\r\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\r\nThe initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBuru (@codeconjurer) .\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
